# PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model

*Publication Date: October 15, 2022*

## Introduction
In this text, we are introduced to PaLM-E, an embodied multimodal language model. The model is designed to understand and respond to human prompts by incorporating visual information. The goal is to explore how robots can assist humans in various tasks.

## Visually-conditioned Jokes + Few-shot prompting
The first example given involves a human prompt and a corresponding robot response. The human prompt is to reach a cookie, and the robot suggests that it can get the cookie. This example demonstrates how the robot can understand the human's intention and offer assistance.

Another example involves visually-conditioned jokes. The human provides a description of an image, and the robot responds with a joke related to the description. This showcases the model's ability to generate humorous responses based on visual cues.

## Assistive Robotics: Physical Reasoning
The next example focuses on physical reasoning. The human provides an image and asks which object is best for climbing up high. The robot correctly identifies a ladder as the best object for climbing. This demonstrates the model's understanding of physical concepts and its ability to provide accurate responses.

## Robot Visual Perception, Dialogue, and Planning
In this section, the robot identifies itself as operating in a kitchen. The human provides an image and asks what the robot sees. The robot correctly identifies a bowl of eggs and a bowl of flour in the image. This showcases the model's ability to perceive visual information and provide accurate descriptions.

## Robot Initiative
The robot is presented with an image and asked what steps it should take to be useful in that situation. The robot suggests cleaning the table, picking up trash, picking up chairs, wiping chairs, and putting chairs down. This example demonstrates the model's ability to generate a sequence of actions based on visual input.

## Zero-shot Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
In this section, the robot is presented with an image and asked if it can go down a certain street on a bicycle. The robot suggests thinking step by step and provides a series of instructions, ultimately concluding that it is possible to go down the street on a bicycle.

Another example involves counting the number of championship rings won by a player in an image. The robot suggests thinking step by step and correctly determines that the player on the left has won five championship rings.

The final example involves identifying teams in a photo, determining the last team to win a championship, the year they won, and the star player that year. The robot provides step-by-step instructions and correctly identifies the teams, the last championship winner, the year of the win, and the star player. However, the robot admits uncertainty and mentions using Google to verify the information.

## Zero-shot: Multi-image Relationships
In this section, the robot is presented with two photos and asked to identify what is in one photo but not in the other. The robot correctly identifies sunglasses as being present in the first photo but not in the second.

Another example involves analyzing the differences between two photos. The robot suggests thinking step by step and explains that the first photo has sunglasses on top of folded clothes, while the second photo does not. This demonstrates the model's ability to compare and analyze visual information.

## OCR-free Math Reasoning
The robot is presented with a question about the total cost of two custom pizzas. The robot suggests thinking step by step and calculates the total cost as $19.98 based on the price of each pizza.

## End-to-End Egocentric Q&A, Dialogue
In this section, the robot is presented with three photos taken at different times. The robot is asked what the person had for lunch and at what time. The robot suggests thinking step by step and correctly determines that the person had a sandwich for lunch at 12:45 pm.

## Conclusion
PaLM-E is an embodied multimodal language model that can understand and respond to human prompts by incorporating visual information. The model demonstrates capabilities in various domains, including humor, physical reasoning, visual perception, planning, and math reasoning. The model's ability to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses showcases its potential for assisting humans in a wide range of tasks.
